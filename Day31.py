    Secure Coding Guidelines

    1. Input Validation
        - Validate all inputs from untrusted sources.
        - Use allow-lists to validate inputs.
        - Avoid using regular expressions for complex input validation.

    2. Authentication
        - Use strong password policies (minimum length, complexity).
        - Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA).
        - Securely store passwords using strong hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2).

    3. Authorization
        - Enforce least privilege principle.
        - Use role-based access control (RBAC).
        - Regularly review and update access controls.

    4. Cryptography
        - Use well-vetted libraries for cryptographic operations.
        - Use strong, industry-standard algorithms (e.g., AES-256).
        - Ensure proper key management (e.g., use a hardware security module).

    5. Error Handling
        - Do not reveal sensitive information in error messages.
        - Use generic error messages for user-facing errors.
        - Log errors for internal review without exposing sensitive data.

    6. Secure Storage
        - Encrypt sensitive data at rest.
        - Use secure storage solutions for sensitive information (e.g., databases with encryption).

    7. Secure Communication
        - Use TLS/SSL for all communications over the network.
        - Ensure certificates are valid and up to date.
        - Avoid using deprecated protocols and ciphers.

    8. Logging and Monitoring
        - Implement logging for security-relevant events.
        - Ensure logs are protected from tampering.
        - Regularly monitor and review logs for suspicious activity.

    9. Code Review and Testing
        - Conduct regular code reviews focusing on security issues.
        - Use static and dynamic analysis tools to identify vulnerabilities.
        - Perform regular security testing, including penetration testing.

    10. Dependency Management
        - Regularly update third-party libraries and dependencies.
        - Use tools to identify and manage vulnerable dependencies.
        - Avoid using outdated or unsupported libraries.

    11. Secure Development Environment
        - Secure development and build environments.
        - Use version control systems with proper access controls.
        - Regularly back up important data and configurations.

    12. Security Training and Awareness
        - Provide regular security training for developers.
        - Stay updated with the latest security trends and best practices.
        - Promote a culture of security within the development team.
